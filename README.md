# LFEditor
A work-in-progress large-file editor written in C++ using QtCreator.

## Features
Currently only supports viewing of files.

## Todo
 1. Viewing of very large files (I have personally tried a 75GB file, which works as expected) [X]
 2. Editing and saving of files [ ]
 3. Saving files as a copy (save as) [ ]
 4. Prebuilt release binaries for Win32 and Win64 downloadable directly from GitHub (This will most likely also become release 1.0.0) [ ]
