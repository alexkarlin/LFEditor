# LFEditor
A work-in-progress large-file editor written in C++ using QtCreator.

## Features
 - [x] Viewing of very large files (I have personally tried a 75GB file, which works as expected)
 - [ ] Editing and saving of files
 - [ ] Saving files as a copy (save as)
 - [ ] Saving individual blocks (save block as)
 - [ ] Prebuilt release binaries for Win32 and Win64 downloadable directly from GitHub (This will most likely also become release 1.0.0)

This list is not final. More features will most likely be added, modified and/or removed prior to the 1.0.0 release.
