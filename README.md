# LFEditor
A work-in-progress large-file editor written in C++ using QtCreator.

## Todo
 - [x] Implement viewing of very large files (I have personally tried a 75GB file, which works as expected)
 - [ ] Implement editing and saving of files
 - [ ] Implement saving files as a copy (save as)
 - [ ] Add an option to keep or remove empty space in a block when saving
 - [ ] Implement saving individual blocks (save block as)
 - [ ] General pre-1.0.0 release code cleanup
 - [ ] Add prebuilt release binaries for Win32 and Win64 downloadable directly from GitHub (This will most likely also become release 1.0.0)

## Bugs
 - [ ] "Are you sure you want to exit?" dialog should only be displayed if the open file hasn't been saved

Keep in mind that these lists are not final. Features could be added, modified, and/or removed prior to the 1.0.0 release.
