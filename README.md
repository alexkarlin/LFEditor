# LFEditor
A work-in-progress large-file editor written in C++ using QtCreator.

## Features
Currently only supports viewing of files.

## Todo
 - [x] Viewing of very large files (I have personally tried a 75GB file, which works as expected)
 - [ ] Editing and saving of files
 - [ ] Saving files as a copy (save as)
 - [ ] Prebuilt release binaries for Win32 and Win64 downloadable directly from GitHub (This will most likely also become release 1.0.0)
